## Expectations

Please keep your expectations low. This is a half baked idea that might not go anywhere. Goodness
knows why I bothered to open source this but I thought some others might be interested.

I'm also new to Rust so am probably making some terrible mistakes.

Please be patent with me. This is just a side project.

Thank you for contributing though. If I take too long to get back to you, I'm sorry, I appreciate
the interest you've taken.

Please always obey the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Please use the [pull request template](./pull_request_template.md).
